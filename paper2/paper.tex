{% Insert summary of the paper here (used in introduction) 
	Large-eddy simulations are performed to investigate the dynamic response of a natural laminar flow airfoil undergoing harmonic pitch oscillations at a chord based Reynolds number of $Re_{c}=750,000$. Large changes in the transition location are observed throughout the pitch cycles which leads to a non-linear response of the aerodynamic force coefficients. Preliminary results show that the evolution of the boundary layer over the airfoil can be modeled by using a simple phase-lag concept which implies that the boundary-layer evolution is quasi-steady in nature. A simple empirical model is developed based on this quasi-steady, phase-lag assumption which fits very well with the measured experimental data.

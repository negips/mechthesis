{% Insert summary of the paper here (used in introduction) 
	We revisit the ``filter-based stabilization'' approach proposed by \cite{fischer01} and find that the loss of divergence-free condition due to commutation errors can be particularly severe in the cases of marginally resolved flows. In light of this, an alternative approach based on ``relaxation-term-based stabilization'' is proposed which is closely related to the explicit filter operation. The method retains the advantages of simplicity and efficiency of an explicit filter while also remedying some of its drawbacks. The effect of this relaxation-term is analyzed and it found to be an effective method of stabilization within the practical parameter range. Parameter limits of the stabilization procedure are also presented.
